* epochs-yew

This is a little web interface to [[https://crates.io/crates/epochs][the epochs crate]]. 

Fill in any box on the right hand side and it will try to fill in the rest.

It uses [[https://crates.io/crates/yew][yew]] and [[https://crates.io/crates/cargo-web][cargo-web]] to build a little interactive web page with [[https://webassembly.org/][Wasm]].

If you clone this repo, you can build it with ~cargo web start~ and then view it locally at http://127.0.0.1:8000

I ran ~cargo web deploy~ and put the results in gh-pages, so you can view it at https://oylenshpeegul.github.io/epochs-yew/
